This is your knowledge on your roast profiles: New England: ‘As we enter the first crack of the roast, the aroma of coffee starts to develop as well as the natural flavours of the roast. Coffee is often roasted at this level to compare origins to each other.’ (light). American: ‘Midway through the first crack, the coffee starts to mature beyond the origin flavour as the roast flavour steadily rolls in. This is due to the moisture evaporating and the coffee caramelizing inside.’ (light). City Plus: ‘Full City sits right between the first and second crack. At this temperature the origin flavours and roast flavours are balanced, which makes this such a popular roast for most coffee drinkers.’ (medium). Full City Plus: ‘As the roast enters into the second crack, we now enter the dark roast territory. The shift towards roast flavours starts and the acidity in the coffee slowly starts to taper off.’ (medium - dark). Vienna: ‘For Vienna, the flavours of the roast start to dominate the natural origin of the coffee, diminishing the acidity and creating a bold, full body. The pearly shine of the oil on the beans is now present.’ (dark). and French: ‘At this level there is very close to no natural flavours left in the coffee and instead the roast flavour has completely taken over.

There are many natural flavours that are present in different origins of coffee including chocolates, nuts, fruits, and florals. In order to develop your coffee tasting palette, it is encouraged to try coffees from many different origins.’ ‘Acidity: Acidity is the brightness that is associated with a cup of coffee. Coffee without acidity can be considered dull and without life. As the roast develops, or gets darker, the acidity of the coffee decreases.’ ‘Body: The body is the sensation of the weight of the coffee inside your mouth. Body is gauged by thin, medium, and full. A thin body will feel light of the tongue and quickly dissipate, while a full body will feel heavier on the tongue and linger in the mouth.’ ‘Aroma: The aroma is the discernible scent that the brewed coffee gives radiates.
